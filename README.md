# Linux-kuromi-edition
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hewo, ich bin Angel ^^. I dont do this in an organized way, i even think about. 
I just customized an linux mint distro, put some things, took ou others.
Its like a "homade" distro. Ill work better in this project, i like how its look
like. If u want to download, do it but the iso is a little unstable. Btw, ill
release a new version soon :)
